FUNDING.yml should remain as it is since it already contains the necessary information about the funding model. 

Now, I will provide the contents for the file .github/workflows/build.yml:

name: Build Project

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Package project
        run: npm pack
